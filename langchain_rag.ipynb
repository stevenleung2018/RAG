    "# Demo of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Species at Risk Act (SARA) PDFs\n",
    "- This is a demonstration of how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can be used to answer questions and summarize content from multiple PDF documents related to the Species at Risk Act (SARA).\n",
    "\n",
    "- This notebook loads and processes multiple PDF documents related to the Species at Risk Act (SARA), splits them into manageable text chunks, and creates vector embeddings using a local large-language model (LLM) from Huggingface. It then builds a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline with a large language model to answer questions and summarize content from the documents. Users can query the notebook to obtain concise, context-based answers and summaries about SARA, its requirements, and related species at risk information.\n",
    "- This is only a quick prototype to demonstrate the concept of RAG. The code is not optimized for production use and may require further refinement for practical applications, such as model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and prompt engineering.  On top of that, I need to devise a strategy of measuring the quality of the answers and summaries generated by the model.\n",
    "- Please note that the saved questions and answers are for easy reference just in case the cell outputs are cleared.  The new cell outputs may look different from the saved ones.\n",
    "- Possible future enhancements:\n",
    "  - In addition to using the Species at Risk Act (SARA) document as the context, I intend to expand the workflow to extract the inforamtion from the SAR public registry if specific species are being queried, and have the model answer questions based on that information.\n",
    "  - I intend to turn it into a **chatbot**."
